#+TODO: INBOX IDEA POTENTIAL-UPGRADE SELECTED NEXT DOING BUG CANCELLED | DONE

* Inbox
* Project Foundations
** DONE Clean up repo, establish Python scaffolding
- [X] Move python to project base
- [X] Start using PyCharm
** POTENTIAL-UPGRADE Agentic workflow (git branches, workspaces)
** POTENTIAL-UPGRADE Jupyter flow integrating Python & Idris
* Milestone: Rotational equivariance MNIST
** Success Criteria
1. Achieves 80% accuracy on rotated digits set
2. Outperforms non-rotational baseline
3. Trains significantly faster than baseline
4. Results directly comparable to ESCNN implementation
** Desired Side Effects
1. Acquired skill & improved tooling in Idris2 and Python ML ecosystem
2. Basic workflow for issues and milestone execution
** Explorations
*** DONE Does ESCNN have existing tests for this?
- [X] Get ESCNN tests to pass
*** DOING Implement rotational MNIST test using escnn library
- [X] Import ESCNN, get tests to pass
- [ ] Move beyond trivial case, use irreps
** Tasks
*** SELECTED Milestone description / outline (README.md)
*** SELECTED Clean up notes
*** SELECTED Implement rotational equivariance on MNIST digits
- Use https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn as reference
*** SELECTED Adapt tests from ESCNN
*** SELECTED Get ESCNN tests to pass locally
*** SELECTED Train idris-gdl on rotated images
